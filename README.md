# Elimination-Of-Unfair-Autcion-Activties
Objective:
This project aims to detect and eliminate unfair practices in online auction environments by applying machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify suspicious patterns and anomalies within bidding data to prevent manipulation and ensure a fair bidding process. This project analyzes historical bid data to recognize outliers and patterns associated with fraudulent activities, leveraging various classification algorithms.

Project Flow:
Data Collection and Loading:

Load the required datasets (e.g., bids.csv, train.csv, test.csv) from Google Drive using Colab.

Inspect and preprocess the data, ensuring that it's in a clean and usable format.

Data Preprocessing:

Apply standard preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features using LabelEncoder and StandardScaler.

Clean up the dataset and ensure it's ready for modeling by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization.

Feature Engineering:

Analyze and extract relevant features that can contribute to the classification task.

Perform statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square) to identify the most important features and improve model performance.

Model Selection:

Train various machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), using cross-validation to assess the generalization of the models.

Use GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Use KFold cross-validation to ensure robustness in model evaluation and test the models' ability to generalize to unseen data.

Fraud Detection:

Focus on detecting suspicious patterns and potential fraudulent activities within the auction dataset.

Apply techniques like anomaly detection to classify fair versus unfair auction behavior.

Reporting and Visualization:

Present the results of the model evaluation with visualizations, including ROC curves and classification reports, to assess the effectiveness of the models in detecting unfair auction activities.

Use time-series analysis or statistical tests to detect unusual bid patterns over time.
